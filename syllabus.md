## Thesis Project Syllabus

### Description

Senior thesis is a year long research project where you will collaborate with a faculty member. While statistics senior theses vary in content and methods, they all require you to practice and develop your ability to think statistically and to extract knowledge from data.  The thesis process also requires you to practice communicating complex statistical methods in an accessible manner.  View thesis as an opportunity to develop and refine your statistical practice skills. Broadly speaking, there are two styles of Math-Stat theses: **data-focused** projects, with emphasis on learning new modeling and analysis techniques and applying them to a data question, and **theory-focused** projects, that investigate a particular advanced topic or method, and either extend it in a new direction or apply it to a new circumstance.

### Learning Outcomes

* Execute a sustained research project that involves statistical problem-solving.
* Identify, analyze, evaluate, and synthesize existing scholarship.
* Write a clear and coherent document in the style and format that is appropriate for a statistical audience.
* Present, discuss, and defend your work orally to statistical and non-statistical audiences.

### Expectations

* You will meet weekly with your advisor.  Prior to those meetings you will complete a research log of your activities for the week and your plans for the upcoming week.  A template log can be found [here](https://github.com/Reed-Statistics/thesis/blob/master/template_log.md).  
* You will write every week.  
* You will meet project deadlines.

### Assessment

* Project engagement
    + Meeting weekly goals
    + Writing reqularly
    + Coming prepared for weekly meetings
    + Maintaining the GitHub Project and pushing work to GitHub repo
    + Communicating problems
    + Meeting project due dates
* Thesis drafts
* Final thesis document
* Oral exam

### General Structure for Data-focused Projects

You should write your thesis using the `thesisdown` r package. (More info [here](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown).) The components of individual theses and the order in which they are put together can vary somewhat, but here are some general guidelines on a common structure:

* Abstract
    + Includes the main objective and rationale for the project, outlines the methods used, presents the key results and conclusions
* Context
    + Addresses what the research problem is, motivates why it is important, provides background material on the topic and other approaches, and identifies what is added by this thesis   
* Overview
    + Briefly introduces the data sources, methods used, and a couple of key findings
* Data
    + Describes the data sources (For each source, should answer: Where did it come from? Who collected it? How was it collected? Why was it originally collected?)
    + Defends choices of which data are utilized and addresses as issues with the data
* Methods 
    + Gives an overview of the current main approaches to the problem.
    + Points out flaws in existing approaches and addresses how the current work mitigates these problems
* Results
    + Includes both descriptive and analytical results
* Discussion and Conclusion
    + Summarizes the findings
    + Describes limitations of the particular project and analysis
    + Discusses aspects of the analysis that could be expanded on
    + Provides key takeaways and recommendations from the domain audience
* Code and data appendix
    + Includes links to github repos if applicable
    + Presents data set or algorithms

### Due Dates for Data-focused Projects

* Sept 11th: Project topic finalized
* Sept 25th: Data sources identified
* Oct 2nd: Three texts related to the project topic identified and summarized
* Oct 23rd: Data chapter draft complete
* Nov 20th: Context chapter draft complete
* Week of Dec 7th: Present in the "Math-Stats Thesis Updates"
* Feb 19th: Methods chapter draft complete
* March 26th: Results chapter draft complete
* April 2nd: Discussion chapter, Overview and Abstract draft complete
* April 9th: Full rough to theis advisor for review and feedback
* April 16th: Code Appendix complete 
* April 30th, 3pm: 4 copies of thesis due at Registrar's Office
* May 14, noon: Thesis due in library

### General Structure for Theory-focused Projects

You may write your thesis using the `thesisdown` r package (More info [here](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown)) or using the Reed LaTex thesis template (More info [here](https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/thesis.html)). The components of individual theses and the order in which they are put together can vary somewhat, but here are some general guidelines on a common structure:

* Abstract
    + Includes the main objective and rationale for the project, outlines the methods used, presents the key results and conclusions
* Context
    + Addresses what the research problem is, motivates why it is important, provides background material on the topic and other approaches, and identifies what is added by this thesis   
* Overview
    + Briefly introduces the main theory or method, the type of analysis used to explore it, and a couple of key applications or extensions
* Foundations
    + Introduces the terminology, framework and existing theory that are strictly necessary to understand the thesis topic
* Theory
    + Describes the theory or method (How does the technqique fit in existing framworks? what are some alternatives?)
    + Defends choices of the theory or method over alternatives
* Results
    + Includes proofs and/or analysis of the main conjectures
    + Provides relevant examples of the theory or method
* Discussion and Conclusion
    + Summarizes the findings
    + Discusses aspects of the analysis that could be expanded on, along with limitations
    + Provides key takeaways and recommendations from the domain audience
* Appendix
    + Includes examples, theorems, and/or proofs that are ancillary to the main result
    + Presents data set or algorithms, if applicable
