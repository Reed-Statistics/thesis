## Syllabus

### Description

Senior thesis is a year long research project where you will collaborate with a faculty member. While statistics senior theses vary in content and methods, they all require you to practice and develop your ability to think statistically and to extract knowledge from data.  The thesis process also require you to practice communicating complex statistical methods in an accessible manner.  View thesis as an opportunity to develop and refine your statistical practice skills.

### Learning Outcomes

* Execute a sustained research project that involves statistical problem-solving.
* Identify, analyze, evaluate, and synthesize existing scholarship.
* Write a clear and coherent document in the style and format that is appropriate for a statistical audience.
* Present, discuss, and defend your work orally to statistical and non-statistical audiences.

### Expectations

* You will meet weekly with your advisor.  Prior to those meetings you will complete a research log of your activities for the week and your plans for the upcoming week.  A template log can be found [here](https://github.com/Reed-Statistics/thesis/blob/master/template_log.md).  
* You will write every week.  
* You will meet project deadlines.

### General Structure 

You should write your thesis using the `thesisdown` r package. (More info [here](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown).) The components of individual theses and the order in which they are put together can vary somewhat, but here are some general guidelines on a common structure:

* Abstract
    + Includes the main objective and rationale for the project, outlines the methods used, presents the key results and conclusions
* Context
    + Addresses what the research problem is, motivates why it is important, provides background material on the topic and other approaches, and identifies what is added by this thesis   
* Overview
    + Briefly introduces the data sources, methods used, and a couple of key findings
* Data
    + Describes the data sources (For each source, should answer: Where did it come from? Who collected it? How was it collected? Why was it originally collected?)
    + Defends choices of which data are utilized and addresses as issues with the data
* Methods 
    + Gives an overview of the current main approaches to the problem.
    + Points out flaws in existing approaches and addresses how the current work mitigates these problems
* Results
    + Includes both descriptive and analytical results
* Discussion (and possibly a Conclusion)
    + Summarizes the findings
    + Discusses aspects of the analysis that could be expanded on, along with limitations
    + Provides key takeaways and recommendations from the domain audience
